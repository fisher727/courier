DPD starts construction of new Amsterdam depot in Vijfhuizen</label>
<div class="boxContent" data-index="news_header2_3990" style="display: none;">
<p>In June package service DPD begins construction of a new Amsterdam depot, in Vijfhuizen. The new distribution centre will increase DPD’s logistics capacity in response to the growing demand in the Greater Amsterdam region. The new location has a floor area of over 11,000m² and is due to be operational in June 2020.</p><a name="eztoc198570_0_0_0_0_1" id="eztoc198570_0_0_0_0_1"></a><h5>Growth strategy</h5><p>The new depot is an important next step in DPD’s growth strategy. Along with Eindhoven and Rotterdam, the Amsterdam region is seen as one of the most important logistics hotspots in the Netherlands. By modernising and expanding its existing infrastructure, DPD can continue to respond to the increasing market demand, bringing international destinations closer to shippers and receivers.</p><p>Once in operation, parcels will be delivered to the Amsterdam depot after an initial sorting in DPD’s national and international HUBs in Europe. Distribution routes will then be sorted, and parcels will be delivered directly to recipients in the Greater Amsterdam region.</p><a name="eztoc198570_0_0_0_0_2" id="eztoc198570_0_0_0_0_2"></a><h5>Latest technology</h5><p>As in the recently opened HUB Eindhoven, the latest technology will also be used here. The ultra-modern LS-4000 CB sorter, the little brother of the sorter in Eindhoven, is the most energy-efficient of its kind, and has an efficiency four times higher than comparable sorters. With a very significant capacity expansion, peak moments will be absorbed easily, and DPD can respond further to the market’s growing demand, with its truly distinctive and familiar Predict service.</p><p>DPD also aims for a high level of automation in the rest of the building. This means employees will focus less on physical sorting and more on monitoring and controlling the process. Not only will this improve working conditions, but it will also raise delivery quality to an even higher level. The Amsterdam depot will also provide work for 100 additional employees in the future.</p><p>Eric Dietz, CEO DPD Nederland: ‘We envisage significant growth in the parcel market in the Amsterdam region. The new distribution centre, which we have developed with Goodman, will offer plenty of opportunities to grow in line with this demand, while also increasing our service level still further. We work hard every day on meeting the needs of senders and receivers and, where possible, exceeding them. The new depot in Amsterdam will let us guarantee our service in terms of speed and flexibility. This is also a great step towards achieving same-day delivery.’</p><a name="eztoc198570_0_0_0_0_3" id="eztoc198570_0_0_0_0_3"></a><h5>Construction development</h5><p>The new distribution centre is being developed in collaboration with Goodman on four hectares of land, located in De Nieuwe Liede business park in Vijfhuizen. The building covers over 11,000m² and will be completed in April 2020. A celebratory opening will be held in June 2020, when DPD will take the building into commission. Agreement on the project’s development was signed ceremoniously this week.</p><p>Lien Standaert, Country Manager of Goodman Netherlands, says: ‘We are very proud of the excellent cooperation between DPD and Goodman. DPD is already an existing customer of ours in Belgium and the United Kingdom, and we are pleased that this cooperation is now being extended to the Netherlands. The development of DPD’s distribution centre in De Nieuwe Liede is a good example of our gateway strategy for developing high-quality buildings close to city centres and densely populated areas.’</p>

DPD strengthens competitive position with the opening of a distribution centre in Eindhoven</label>
<div class="boxContent" data-index="news_header3_3990" style="display: none;">
<p><i>Hypermodern 'green sorter' Eindhoven HUB is an international hub for parcels from all over Europe</i></p><p>As of this month, the Eindhoven region can boast a highly innovative distribution centre. This strengthens the international competitive position of the DPD parcel service. On 11 April, DPD opened the largest international parcel sorting and distribution centre in Europe, the Eindhoven HUB. This new site has a surface area of 88,000 m<sup>2</sup> and a sorting system of over 2.1 kilometres, making DPD ready for the future and for the growth of the market. In phase two, the site will be expanded by a further 36,000 m<sup>2</sup> .</p><p>DPD's innovative character is reflected in the entire design. The ultramodern LS-4000 CB sorter, also known as 'green sorter ', is the beating heart of the building. With a capacity of 50,000 parcels per hour, it offers a lot of flexibility to cope with peaks. The sorting process is fully automated, allowing parcels to be sorted in the building for only a few minutes. The sorting machine also has a minimal CO2 footprint due to the start-stop system, which is also used in cars, and in this way ensures a 75 percent reduction in energy consumption.</p><p>
<b>Innovation and international growth&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><br />The new distribution centre, with its combined function, offers many opportunities for both the Netherlands and the rest of Europe. On the one hand as a depot for regional delivery and on the other hand as an international hub and transhipment location for large-scale transport. In this way, DPD not only connects Rotterdam Mainport, Schiphol (Customs Clearance) and the logistics hotspot Eindhoven, but also enables European destinations within a radius of 800 kilometres to qualify for next day delivery for the benefit of both recipients and senders. In the event of a 'no deal Brexit', Eindhoven HUB is also a crucial hub for parcel volumes to and from the United Kingdom. Not only for the Netherlands, but also for neighbouring countries as far as Poland. The entire customs procedure will be handled digitally for approximately 60,000 shipments per day.</p><p>
<b>Eindhoven region</b><br />The new distribution centre will provide the Eindhoven region with an even better connection to the international logistics network. The market is growing and the number of online purchases is increasing. Days like Black Friday and Cyber Monday require an international approach. Consumers expect speed and flexibility, such as same-day-delivery, and DPD facilitates this from its Eindhoven base. All 500 employees of the current location will move to the new Eindhoven HUB. The new location on the Westfields industrial estate in Oirschot, located to the northwest of Eindhoven, also offers various scaling up possibilities and will be expanded by a further 36,000 m<sup>2</sup> in phase two.</p><p>Eric Dietz, CEO of DPD Netherlands: &quot;The new Eindhoven HUB offers plenty of opportunities to grow with the demands of the market. This allows us to respond even better to the needs of senders and recipients of parcels and to process peak volumes quickly. The distribution centre is by far the largest HUB in the DPD network and occupies a very important position for DPD's international network in Europe. As such, Eindhoven HUB is fully in line with DPD's ambition to achieve sustainable growth in an innovative way&quot;.</p><p>
<b>Opening</b> <br />The opening of Eindhoven HUB did not pass unnoticed. Hugo De Jonge, minister of Health, Welfare and Sports, and world top squash players Ali Farag and Nour El Sherbini opened the new distribution centre on 11 April. In the week of the opening there was also an international squash event, the DPD Open, an initiative of DPD organized by the PSA. With a $200,000 prize pool for men and women, this tournament ranks among the top 10 biggest squash events in the world. The world's leading international players had travelled to Eindhoven and the event was broadcast live via Eurosport Player and Squash TV for all countries outside Europe.</p>

Parcel service DPD introduces new home pickup service</label>
<div class="boxContent" data-index="news_header4_3990" style="display: none;">
<p><i>Consumers and small businesses can arrange to have their parcels picked up from home </i></p><p>
Parcel service <a href="../../../../nl.html" id="nl" target="_self">DPD</a> introduces the 'Pickup request' service for consumers and small businesses. This means that they no longer need to go out in all weathers to take their parcels to a parcel shop. They can now wait at home until the driver collects them. The new service has been introduced in response to the increasing user demand for parcels to be picked up from home. The pickup service is unique in the Netherlands and available in all regions. Until recently, only business customers could use the service. <br />
<br />
<b>Pickup service</b><br />
Every month, thousands of people use DPD's online shipment platform <a href="https://www.pakkettenversturen.nl/#/banner" id="banner" target="_self">pakkettenversturen.nl</a>. DPD was increasingly asked whether they could pick up parcels from home too. Large businesses with a subscription have been using a pickup service for some time, but this was not yet the case for small businesses and private consumers. By introducing the new pickup service, DPD now offers them the same convenience. <br />
<br /> Eric Dietz, CEO at DPD Nederland: &quot;We're really proud of this national launch. All our customers, from consumers to businesses, are important to us. We're keen to hear their ideas. There was a huge demand for pickup options. With the new Pickup request service, we are responding to that demand and offering every business and consumer the convenience of home collection. The new service therefore totally reflects our aim to give customers the best possible experience.&quot;</p><p>
<b>Time slot</b><br /> The pickup service is unique in the Netherlands and available in all regions. For a fixed charge, regardless of the number of parcels, the driver will pick up the parcels. Thanks to this expansion of the services, it is not only customers who are due to receive a parcel who are informed about the day and time slot of the delivery. Customers who submit a pickup request will receive a reminder a working day in advance that the parcel will be collected. On the morning of the pickup, they will receive an e-mail giving them a 1-hour time slot for collection.</p>

Dutch man is 'big spender' during online shopping</label>
<div class="boxContent" data-index="news_header5_3990" style="display: none;">
<p><i>Dutch men spend more money online than women</i></p><p>Dutch men spend more money online than women. Women spend an average 75 euros compared with male consumers who spend 93 euros. Dutch consumers spend on online shopping. On average they buy 13 items on the Internet a year and spent around 84 euros during their most recent online shopping session. Most money is spent on clothing (60% of all purchases), shoes (39%) and gadgets (35%). These figures were provided by the E-Shopper Barometer published by parcel delivery experts <a href="../../../../nl.html" id="nl" target="_self">DPD</a>. Conducted by Kantar TNS among 24,871 e-shoppers worldwide, including 1,023 Dutch shoppers.</p><p><b>Complicated returns process puts e-shoppers off</b></p><p>Although online shopping is becoming increasingly popular, the survey also presents reasons why Dutch consumers are unwilling to shop on the Internet. The number one reason is the complicated returns process. Three quarters of Dutch shoppers say that this is a no-go for them during online shopping. Items that are not in stock (70%) and poor reviews by fellow shoppers on social media (69%) are other reasons why Dutch consumers stay away from webshops. 55+ consumers have another number one: 83 percent don't shop online if there aren't enough security checks when making payments.</p><p>Eric Dietz, CEO at DPD Nederland: ‘Black Friday, Sinterklaas and Christmas are all round the corner. The last months of the year are a peak period for (online) retailers and the parcel market. Consumers are spending more and more money online. With people ordering online more frequently, an efficient, fast and transparent delivery system is essential. To retain the loyalty of online shoppers, retailers must remove the barriers, such as long delivery times and complicated returns processes. Clear, fast delivery is also very important. DPD is constantly innovating and renewing these processes to support retailers. Because they need to meet these requirements and retain the loyalty of the critical consumer.’</p>

Parcel delivery company DPD enters strategic partnership with VANAD Group</label>
<div class="boxContent" data-index="news_header6_3990" style="display: none;">
<p>
<i>Partnership to further optimise customer satisfaction in growing market</i> <br />
<br />
<i>Best, 31 October 2018</i>&nbsp;– <a href="../../../../nl.html" id="nl" target="_self">Parcel delivery company DPD</a> has entered a strategic partnership with <a href="https://www.vanadgroup.com/nl/" id="" target="_self">VANAD Group</a>. Since September this year, customer care expert VANAD Group has been taking care of the customer service for recipients of DPD services, including contact by telephone, e-mail and social media. The partnership will make it possible to accelerate the process of optimising and innovating customer contact and the customer experience.<br />
<br />
<b>Customer-oriented growth</b><b> </b><br />
<b> </b>The aim of the partnership is to increase the focus on serving customers and the specific use of innovations from which both recipients and senders can benefit. DPD has formulated an ambitious growth strategy in which customer satisfaction is key. From April 2019, DPD will be doubling its parcel capacity by opening a completely new state-of-the-art distribution centre in Eindhoven. The partnership with VANAD Group is a logical step in achieving both objectives, and customer experience is an important pillar.<br />
<br />
Eric Dietz, CEO of DPD Nederland: “Every parcel is unique and means something for both the sender and the recipient. We do everything we can to deliver parcels faster, but also to keep improving our services to customers. We want to grow not only in terms of revenue and volume, but also with respect to customer focus and innovation. In close collaboration with VANAD Group, we have transferred certain activities to them in recent months. We are confident that this partnership will help us further enhance our service provision.”<br />
<br /> VANAD Group also underlines the importance of a joint mission. Yvonne de Keijzer, general manager of VANAD Engage: “We work with organisations that match our DNA and that want, are able and dare to change to get the best out of themselves. We feel that DPD is an ideal match. In addition to the leading retailers we have been working with for many years, we now also have a partnership for the ‘last mile delivery’ in the retail sector. This partnership fits perfectly with our role as a challenger, a capacity in which our people – supported by technological and innovative solutions – make a real difference, each and every day.”</p>

DPDgroup en Renault lanceren zelfrijdende conceptcar voor last mile delivery</label>
<div class="boxContent" data-index="news_header7_3990" style="display: none;">
<p><i>De zelfrijdende conceptauto Z35.2 werd gisteren door Renault Light Commercial Vehicles in het Duitse Hannover onthuld</i></p><p><i>Best, 20 september 2018</i> – Pakketbezorger <a href="../../../../nl.html" id="nl" target="_self">DPDgroup</a> en autofabrikant Renault werken samen aan innovatieve oplossingen om het bezorgproces in steden te verbeteren. Gisteren werd in Hannover de zelfrijdende conceptauto Z35.2<i>&nbsp;</i>gepresenteerd. Z35.2 wordt gebruikt als mobiele kluis, waardoor DPDgroup de afleverpunten van te voren inplant en een notificatie kan sturen naar de consument. Consumenten kunnen op deze manier zelf pakketten ophalen en retourneren op een locatie in de buurt. Het voertuig wordt bij een sorteercentrum van DPDgroup aan de rand van de stad geladen en rijdt zelf naar het ontmoetingspunt in het stadscentrum. Daar neemt de bezorger het&nbsp;stuur over, zonder tijd te&nbsp;verliezen in het sorteercentrum. De bezorger kan zo meer tijd besteden aan het bezorgen van pakketten.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

De last mile delivery market groeit en zal naar verwachting ook in de toekomst exponentieel groeien. Het toenemende aantal online aankopen leidt tot een verdubbeling van het aantal pakketten dat bezorgd moet worden, een totaal van 15 miljard pakketten per jaar in 2025. Een groot deel van deze pakketten wordt bezorgd in steden, terwijl gemeenten tegelijkertijd steeds meer plannen maken om de verkeersdrukte en vervuiling te verminderen. Vanuit dit perspectief is het aan bezorgdiensten zoals DPDgroup om bij te dragen aan duurzame steden door betere en slimmere bezorgprocessen te ontwikkelen.</p><p>Het toenemende aantal pakketten vraagt om innovatieve oplossingen. Met de zelfrijdende auto van Renault kan een deel van de pakketten met een ongekende mate van flexibliteit bezorgd worden.</p><p>Thomas Steverding, Senior Group Manager Process &amp; Development bij DPDgroup: &quot;Dit project laat zien hoe het geoptimaliseerd bezorgen van pakketten bij de consument vorm kan geven aan het toekomstige leven in de stad door groenere oplossingen met de kortst mogelijke afstand door te voeren. DPDgroup is enthousiast dat zij die visie kan delen met Renault, een belangrijke speler in de auto-industrie.&quot;</p>

Paying for overweight baggage hits the wrong note</label>
<div class="boxContent" data-index="news_header8_3990" style="display: none;">
<p><i>The Dutch have missed their bicycles the most on holiday this year</i></p><p>Best, 6 September 2018 – For around half (59%) of Dutch holiday-makers, the bill for overweight baggage spoils the anticipation of their holiday. It is seen as the biggest clinch factor. Where most travellers feel a little bit ‘conned’ (37%), others think it’s annoying that airlines apply different rates (29%). The uncertainty is also a ‘no go’ for many of the Dutch because overweight baggage is sometimes overlooked (18%). This is illustrated by an on-line sample from parcel delivery service DPD of around 650 holiday-makers.</p><p>Once on vacation, almost three quarters of them are fed up that they have to leave things at home to avoid excess weight. The item most missed on holiday is a bicycle and other means of transport. This year, 41 per cent of holiday-makers have missed this. Barbecues and beach items are ranked equal second (20%) followed by sports accessories (15%). These items are usually left at home due to a lack of space or to avoid excess weight (58%). Only 21 per cent thought that they did not need these items or had simply forgotten the items (12%).</p><p>Eric Dietz, CEO of DPD Netherlands: “It is becoming increasingly easy and cheap to send parcels, even across borders. This may be a solution for people going on holiday. We’ve therefore made a few humorous videos as part of ‘I’m going on holiday and I … DPD’. We want to seize this moment to show how easily accessible international shipment is. We are committed to making parcel shipments easier each day. We carry 4 million parcels a day by road internationally and that makes us the biggest in Europe.”</p><p>

Dutch consumers are in the lead with returning parcels</label>
<div class="boxContent" data-index="news_header9_3990" style="display: none;">
<p><i>Half of the returned parcels consist of clothing ordered online</i></p><p>Best, 24 July 2018 - Dutch consumers are returning items they have purchased online en masse. With a return percentage of 9 per cent, the Netherlands is the leader in Europe. The Netherlands is closely followed by the UK, Belgium and Switzerland with 8 per cent. Half of all returned parcels in the Netherlands consist of clothing. This is a considerable increase compared to the previous year, namely 35 per cent in 2016. This creates the impression that, according to the consumer, the option of returning is an essential service when shopping online. This is evident from the <a href="https://www.eshopperbarometer.dpdgroup.com/" id="" target="_self">E-Shopper Barometer</a> of parcel deliverer <a href="../../../../nl.html" id="nl" target="_self">DPD</a>. The study was carried out by Kantar TNS among 24,871 e-shoppers from 22 countries, including 1,023 Dutch citizens.</p><p>
<b>Delivery and return options are becoming increasingly important</b><br />A large proportion of the Dutch people (89%) consider free returns to be important for online shopping, followed by transparent return costs (86%) and the possibility of delivering a parcel to a delivery point (75%). If webshops do not meet these conditions, e-shoppers are more likely to ignore this webshop. When it comes to delivery, e-shoppers also make high demands. They wish to have complete control over the delivery location, day and time. Consumers even want to be able to change their delivery time when the parcel is already on its way. A majority (81%) cited this as the main reason for ordering more frequently from webshops, followed by 77 percent who mentioned evening delivery.</p><p>Eric Dietz, CEO DPD Netherlands: ‘Alongside the increase in online purchases, the number of returns has also increased massively in recent years. As a parcel deliverer, we are responding to this by facilitating more parcel delivery points. DPD now has more than 32,000 parcel delivery points in 26 countries and this will only increase in the future. These purpose-built locations are the perfect place for consumers to return their parcels. After all, they like to take control of the situation. The E-Shopper Barometer is one of our annual consumer surveys designed to find out exactly what is going on. We support retailers with these insights, but also with efficient services and innovative solutions to align their services with the consumer.’</p>

An easier way to return parcels with DPD Predict</label>
<div class="boxContent" data-index="news_header10_3990" style="display: none;">
<p>Best, 16 July – <i>Parcel delivery company DPD is introducing Predict for Collection Request. This service enables buyers to provide the best possible service to customers returning parcels. The returns are collected from the customers and delivered to the warehouse or a third party. The customer receives a text message or email alert the evening before the pick-up giving the collection date. Another message follows in the morning of the pick-up giving the one-hour time slot in which the parcel will be collected. This highly convenient service increases the chance of a successful first collection attempt.</i></p><p><b>Predict: both deliveries and returns</b></p><p>Predict was already available for those wishing to have a parcel delivered. The one-hour service is now available for buyers wishing to have a parcel collected as well, for example if their customer wishes to return a product. But the Predict service can also be used if a parcel is to be sent to a recipient but first has to be collected from a different location than usual, such as a warehouse, or if a parcel is moved from one business location to another.</p><p>Eric Dietz, CEO of DPD: “After successfully introducing Predict for our delivery options, we are now launching the service for returns as well. The proactive message service therefore means that our customers can offer their customers an extra service. This makes it easier for every link in the chain to return parcels and increases the chance of a successful first collection attempt. Besides being very easy to use, Predict also helps reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions – by 4%. Predict thus dovetails perfectly with the future we all envisage.”</p><p>Predict for Collection Request is available from 1 June for parcel collections within the Netherlands, although without redirect options and live tracking at this time.</p>

DPDgroup reduces its carbon emissions 11.2% </label>
<div class="boxContent" data-index="news_header11_3990" style="display: none;">
<p>Parcel shipping company <a href="../../../../index.html" id="" target="_self">DPDgroup</a> delivered 1.1 billion carbon-neutral shipments and is thus 1<sup>st</sup> on the European voluntary offset market. DPDgroup is also making progress in the area of emissions. Because the volume of parcels grew by 10% in 2017, the parcel shipping service was able to maintain its active CO<sub>2</sub> emissions reduction programme. CO<sub>2</sub> emissions fell by 1.6% compared with 2016, and by 11.2% compared with 2013. In 2017, the DPDgroup achieved its next aim of reducing CO<sub>2</sub> through a Science-based Targets initiative. The development of innovative services also helped reduce emissions, for example Predict, which reduces last mile emissions by 4%.</p><p>
<b>Carbon neutral deliveries at no extra cost</b><br />DPDgroup is committed to providing all its customers with carbon-neutral parcel shipping at no extra cost. DPDgroup’s carbon neutral commitment is part of the DrivingChange<sup>TM</sup> programme and relies on three interrelated principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Measuring closely its own CO2 footprint</li>
<li>Reducing its own emissions supported by an internal carbon fund, using alternative fuel vehicles and fuel-efficient driving, optimising routes and maximising load capacity of the fleet. Moreover, the addition of 2000 vehicles complying with Euro 6 norm reduced the average age of the fleet to less than 5 years.</li>
<li>Offsetting through investments in 7 renewable and clean energy projects which are verified by the most rigorous standards on the market.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Eric Dietz, CEO DPD Netherlands: </b>“As a delivery expert, our actions are designed to be the most efficient possible in the interest of our customers. We therefore focus on initiatives where we can make the biggest difference and support key changes in our society. To support of urban logistics projects, all European business units began building tailored urban logistics schemes, by adopting new urban locations and opting for low carbon transport alternatives. This is a crucial step towards contributing even more to reducing pollution and congestion in city centres. And we are finding that our customers don’t need to pay anything extra for this.”</p><p>DPDgroup leads the world in the CEP sector where voluntary CO2 offsetting is involved. This is good for almost 5% of all CO2 emissions that are voluntarily offset in Europe.

Parcel delivery smarter through collaboration between DPD and TNO</label>
<div class="boxContent" data-index="news_header13_3990" style="display: none;">
<p><i>Strategic collaboration to accelerate innovation in the logistics sector</i></p><p>Best, 24 May - Parcel service provider <a href="../../../../nl.html" id="nl" target="_self">DPD</a> and research organisation <a href="https://www.tno.nl/nl/" id="" target="_self">TNO</a> conclude a strategic partnership to lift and accelerate technical innovation in the logistics sector to a higher level. The parties focus on innovation with regard to vehicles, data analytics, robotics and automation. TNO and DPD develop concrete projects on the basis of a joint innovation agenda, within which experiments can be carried out. The first concrete development of the partnership is the SOLiD project, aimed at a self-organising parcel delivery system.</p><p>

Another important issue on the innovation agenda is sustainability. For example, feasibility research is now being done into zero emission parcel delivery in Rotterdam.</p><p>Eric Dietz, CEO at DPD Netherlands: “&quot;As a result of the growth of e-commerce and the demand for deliveries, the parcel delivery market is increasingly taking shape. This has an impact on society and on the environment. Think of emission gases in densely populated cities. This requires innovative solutions and an application of new technology. It also requires innovation in the sector and to accelerate this we are looking for ways both inside and outside our organisation. It is our ambition to improve life in and around cities.

We are able to test accelerated innovations in practice and then develop and implement them in one fell swoop by a competent market leader like DPD. In doing so we learn and adjust. It is especially important to start, so that the market can continue to fulfil the wishes of the consumer in a responsible manner. Using the joint innovation agenda and collaboration, we are able to use existing knowledge more easily and meet the current challenges in terms of mobility and urbanization.&quot;</p><p><b>-----------------------------------------------------------------------</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p>

DPD gives the official green light for construction of the new HUB Eindhoven distribution centre </label>
<div class="boxContent" data-index="news_header18_3990" style="display: none;">
<p><b>Best, 2 February 2018 -&nbsp; Construction of the new hypermodern DPD distribution centre has now officially started. Eric Dietz CEO DPD Netherlands and Piet Machielsen, an alderman for the municipality of Oirschot, have driven the first pile for the new building. It will rise up from the ground at the Westfields business park in Oirschot over the course of the next year. This state-of-the art distribution centre will serve DPD Netherlands well for many years to come. For example, putting the company in a position to continue to offer a high-quality service in the booming parcel market and strengthen its cross-border position. </b></p><p>HUB Eindhoven will initially cover an area of approximately 88,000 square metres and will be extended by a further 36,000 square metres at a later stage. This ties in seamlessly with the growth expected. All 500 employees at the current location in Best will relocate to HUB Eindhoven at the beginning of 2019. The official start of this new-build project was attended by all of the various parties involved, including representatives of the contractor, Stam &amp; De Koning, the BEUMER Group and the municipality of Oirschot.</p><p><b>Rick Pardoel, Manager Real Estate DPD Netherlands:</b> “Our new sorting machine, which we use to process 50.000 parcels per hour, is the beating heart of DPD. It formed the starting point for the design of the distribution centre, which is a complete reversal of the traditional approach to new-build projects. Normally, the building is constructed first, after which attention turns to where to position machines. The new HUB will enable us to respond to opportunities for growth, demand from the market and peak volume.”</p><p><b>Eric Dietz, CEO DPD Netherlands:</b> “We are very happy to have reached this point. After many years of planning, the ball has now actually started to roll. We have taken the opportunity that this new-build project is presenting us with to subject our processes to a close critical examination. This is our chance to put limitations behind us and construct a building that will give us the best possible chance of achieving our ambitions for the future. The new location will give us the opportunity to continue to grow. We will be able to process more parcels, provide more clients with a high-quality service and expand our (logistics) network at an international level. We can't wait to start using this hyper modern building, in which the emphasis will be on efficiency, safety and the achievement of the highest level of sustainability possible.”</p>

DPD now delivering parcels by bike too </label>
<div class="boxContent" data-index="news_header19_3990" style="display: none;">
<p><b><u>DPD Netherlands</u></b><b>&nbsp;is now delivering parcels by bike too, having joined forces with Fietskoeriers.nl to create a new delivery option. The service is now available in Eindhoven, for both business and private customers. It enables DPD and Fietskoeriers.nl to strengthen their market position in the field of sustainable parcel delivery, particularly given the prospect of this service’s expansion to the rest of the Netherlands in the future.</b></p><p>To compensate for the emissions produced by the company's vehicles, DPD is buying emissions rights to finance green and renewable energy projects. DPD and EcoAct, the European leader in the CO<sub>2</sub> market, have come together to create a compensation programme that meets the strictest international standards.</p><p>DPD's cooperation with Fietskoeriers.nl is in the same vein, but does more too: this delivery option is ideal for the achievement of smart deliveries to customers in towns and cities. Fast delivery can be guaranteed even in situations where congestions would delay other delivery options. More than 74% of the Dutch population live in a town or city. Fietskoeriers.nl is now delivering parcels to four areas of Eindhoven, using electric cargo bikes for standard parcels and an electric car for big parcels. Delivering parcels to a growing number of customers every day, DPD is reducing its impact on roads via its cooperation with Fietskoeriers.nl.</p><p><b>Eric Dietz, CEO DPD Netherlands</b>: “We do everything we can, every day, to make sure that parcels are delivered quickly and in lines with the wishes of our customers. Our cooperation with Fietskoeriers.nl enables us to improve the quality of life in towns and cities and also to honour the commitment we have made to the environment. It's another important step towards the achievement of sustainable, CO<sub>2</sub>-neutral delivery to our customers.”</p><p>“This cooperation fits in perfectly with our strategy, which is to be the ultimate last-mile carrier”, says <b>Colette van Boxtel, Marketing Director at Fietskoeriers.nl</b>. “You could see us as the ultimate last-mile white label. We deliver to everyone. This reduces the number of fossil-fuel vehicles in towns and cities and makes them more pleasant places to live in too. I think it’s really great that we are helping an international player like DPD to achieve its sustainability targets!”&nbsp;</p>

DPDgroup presents Europeans’ latest online shopping habits</label>
<div class="boxContent" data-index="news_header20_3990" style="display: none;">
<p class=" text-center"><i>The 2017 “E-shopper barometer” report<sup>*</sup> </i></p><p class=" text-center"><i>highlights this year’s trends and opportunities</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Key take-aways</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Online experience:</b> the vast majority of e-shoppers consider their most recent online purchasing experience as ‘very positive’, and found their experience ‘easy’.</li>
<li><b>Cross-border e-shopping:</b> cross-border purchases are growing significantly, especially for products originating from China. There is still room for strong growth as one third of e-shoppers are willing to start purchasing abroad.</li>
<li><b>M-commerce: </b>smartphones are increasingly used to make online purchases, especially among heavy buyers and millennials.</li>
<li><b>Delivery:</b> the home is still by far the most used delivery location, but interest for alternatives is growing e.g. parcel shops, retailer stores, and lockers.</li>
<li><b>Local strategies:</b> delivery and payment preferences vary widely from one country to the other. To meet customers’ expectations and further develop e-commerce activities, e-tailers must think local to maximise opportunities.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>&nbsp;“This year’s report underlines the clear potential that cross-border shopping represents. One of three key features that can favour online cross-border purchases is related to local behaviours and requirements as well as shoppers’ specific needs in each market. Mobile-friendly platforms is the second to cater for the rise in m-commerce. Last but not least, ensure an impeccable first experience for new e-shoppers would secure their loyalty in the long term.”</i> <i>- </i>Jean-Claude Sonet, Marketing Director, DPDgroup.</p>

DPD en Sandd bieden samen voordelige kerstzegels aan</label>
<div class="boxContent" data-index="news_header21_3990" style="display: none;">
<p><i>Vanaf 27 november via DPD Pickup Parcelshops op elke kerstzegel bijna 25 cent besparing</i></p><p><b>DPD gaat met Sandd samenwerken bij de verkoop van kerstzegels. Vanaf maandag 27 november worden de Sandd kerstzegels verkocht voor € 0,50 (incl. 21% btw) in ruim 100 DPD Pickup parcelshops. DPD en het Nederlandse postbedrijf willen hiermee de concurrentie aan gaan met duurdere zegels. Met de kerstzegels wordt dit jaar tevens het goede doel Pink Ribbon ondersteunt.</b></p><p>Jaarlijks versturen Nederlanders meer dan 100 miljoen kerstkaarten per post aan elkaar. DPD en Sandd bieden daarom dit jaar voor het eerst kerstzegels aan. Naast de reguliere zegels van Sandd, kunnen consumenten en bedrijven nu ook profiteren van de zeer voordelige kerstzegels, verkrijgbaar in de 100 geselecteerde DPD Parcelshops.</p><p>De kerstzegel kost slechts €0,50. Dat scheelt bijna 25 cent per zegel t.o.v. de huidige decemberzegel van € 0,73. Een vel van 20 kerstzegels kost&nbsp; € 10,-. Dankzij de samenwerking tussen DPD en Sandd zijn de zegels door heel Nederland verkrijgbaar.</p><p>Klanten kunnen hun kerstkaarten in een speciale kerstbrievenbus van Sandd in de DPD Pickup parcelshops inleveren. Klanten die één of meer velletjes Sandd kerstzegels kopen mogen gratis 1 pakket binnen Nederland versturen via het online verzendplatform van DPD, <a href="https://www.pakkettenversturen.nl/#/banner" id="banner" target="_self">pakkettenversturen.nl</a></p><p>Thiemo van Spellen, CCO DPD Nederland: “DPD en Sandd vullen elkaar natuurlijk aan; wij doen de pakketten, zij doen de post. Door samen te werken kunnen wij gezamenlijke kansen creëren, onze retailnetwerken verbeteren én laten groeien. Ook gaan we hiermee de concurrentie aan met andere, duurdere bezorgdiensten. We vinden het mooi dat we deze alternatieve en goedkopere verzendmethode onze klanten kunnen aanbieden en tegelijk bijdragen aan een belangrijk goed doel.”</p><p>
<b><u>Pink Ribbon</u></b><br /><b><u> </u></b>Sandd heeft de verkoop van de kerstzegel gekoppeld aan een goed doel. Kerst is namelijk niet alleen een periode van feestvreugde en gezelligheid, voor veel mensen is het ook een moeilijke tijd, bijvoorbeeld in verband met een heftige ziekte. In Nederland wordt bij 1 op de 7 vrouwen jaarlijks borstkanker geconstateerd; dat is een ingrijpende persoonlijke gebeurtenis. Daarom doneert Sandd een deel van de opbrengst dit jaar aan Pink Ribbon. Zij financieren wetenschappelijk onderzoek en projecten op het gebied van behandeling, nazorg en langetermijneffecten van borstkanker. Kijk voor meer informatie op <a href="https://www.pinkribbon.nl/" id="" target="_self">pinkribbon.nl</a>. </p><p>Van ieder verkocht zegelvel doneert Sandd € 0,25 aan dit goede doel. De kerstzegels zijn vanaf 27 november te koop via de Sandd webshop en bij de Sandd postpunten, waaronder geselecteerde DPD Pickup Parcelshops <a href="https://www.sandd.nl/postpunt/" id="" target="_self">https://www.sandd.nl/postpunt/</a>). Hier kan de kerstpost ook weer worden ingeleverd.</p><p>
<b><u>DPD en Sandd</u></b><br /><b><u> </u></b>Dit is niet de eerste samenwerking tussen DPD en Sandd, vorig jaar plaatste zij samen frankeermachines van Sandd bij MKB-ers op locatie. DPD heeft in Nederland bijna 800&nbsp;Pickup parcelshops, hiervan zijn er 100 geselecteerd door Sandd in gebieden waar ze nog geen dekking hadden met eigen postpunten of andere servicepunten. Doordat Sandd alleen bezorgd op dinsdag en vrijdag, en daarbij zeer efficiënt werkt, kunnen zij zeer scherpe prijzen bieden aan consumenten en bedrijven.</p>

DPDgroup is ready for the year-end period, opening with Black Friday</label>
<div class="boxContent" data-index="news_header22_3990" style="display: none;">
<p><b>Black Friday development in Europe </b></p><p>Peak period is a year-end shipped parcels volume increase phenomenon, linked to Christmas gifts. This period traditionally runs through December. In the last few years, this period has extended over the first half of January with the online gift-reselling phenomenon.</p><p>Meanwhile, « Black Friday » (on November 24<sup>th</sup> this year) followed by « Cyber Monday » (on November 27<sup>th</sup> this year), coming from American traditions, are developing today in some European countries thanks to e-commerce.</p><p>Peak period is now spreading from late November to half of January.</p><p>In 2016, the Black Friday week generated a 20% average increase of DPDgroup delivered parcels in Europe, with wide discrepancies among countries.</p><p><b>&nbsp;Year-end preparation</b></p><p>Year-end period entails a strong increase of volume handled in the last weeks. Indeed, in 2016 DPDgroup observed a 20% increase of its volumes during year-end period, even reaching +35% on some days.</p><p>This year, DPDgroup expects a similar growth of its volumes. Considering annual increase of traffic and its peaks, DPDgroup plans to deliver more than 6 million parcels per day on the busiest days, at the end of this year.</p><p>Therefore, like every year before « peak period », DPDgroup teams are joining forces to handle these seasonal volume records. Our experts in each country adapt resources according to their forecasts: transport capacity increase, delivery operation growth, additional sorting centre, team reinforcement, etc.</p><p>Year-end period is also the opportunity to internally create solidarity between services, so that this challenge leads to customer satisfaction. For example, headquarters staff can support delivery teams.</p>

DPD to double parcel capacity in new premises</label>
<div class="boxContent" data-index="news_header24_3990" style="display: none;">
<p><i>Investment in a hypermodern sorting machine&nbsp;</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Best, 11 September 2017 – Parcel service DPD is going to double its parcel processing capacity at its new Dutch headquarters in the Eindhoven region. In order to respond to the increased growth in the e-commerce market, the company is investing in an ultra-modern new sorter: the “LS-4000 CB sorter”. Also referred to as “the green sorter”, this machine is manufactured by the BEUMER Group and offers a maximum processing capacity of 50,000 parcels an hour. </b></p><p>DPD's new headquarters, 'HUB Eindhoven', will open at the start of 2019. The hub will operate around the clock and cover some 23,000 square metres. It will offer DPD and its customers direct access to the most important highway networks in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. In short, the most ideal location for modern logistics in this region.</p><p>Eric Dietz, CEO at DPD: “We are always looking for new ways to better serve our customers and deliver parcels faster. Our investment in the new sorting system is perfectly in line with our growth strategy for the Dutch market. This innovative system will soon form the beating heart of our new premises in Eindhoven. More specifically, this will mean more than a doubling of our current capacity in Best, as a result of which we will be able to provide our customers with an even better and faster parcel delivery service. At the end of the day, that's what it’s all about.”</p><p>The purchase of the sorting machine also marks the start for DPD of a 10-year partnership with manufacturer of intralogistics solutions the BEUMER Group. They will supply and install the new sorter, and be responsible for its maintenance. DPD has chosen the BEUMER Group because of its worldwide position in the areas of transport, packaging, sorting and distribution. The sorter has been decisive in the design chosen for the new premises. The purchase of the sorter was thus completed at an earlier stage of the process.</p>

Cross-border tool for entrepreneurs goes live </label>
<div class="boxContent" data-index="news_header26_3990" style="display: none;">
<p><b>The tool helps e-commerce entrepreneurs expand overseas, for example in France or Spain.</b></p><p>The threshold e-commerce companies must cross if they want to do business abroad is high. Entrepreneurs have to make decisions about whether to expand into one or more countries, designing a web shop and setting up shipments. 23 e-commerce professionals within the Cross Border E-commerce Expert Group of Shopping Tomorrow (from companies such as <a href="http://bol.com/" id="" target="_blank">bol.com</a>, Noppies, Salesupply and DPD) have assessed this material and developed an online cross-border tool.</p><p>Entrepreneurs to use this tool to obtain advise that is based on their own situation. This makes it easier for them to venture into a foreign country. The advice could concern areas such as marketing, regulations, shipments and setting up a web shop. The first advice available relates to a roll-out into France or Spain. The intention is to expand the tool with recommendations for other interesting e-commerce countries.</p><p>One of the experts, Sjoukje Goldman MSc (marketing strategy teacher, project leader from the ‘Crossborder Ecommerce in Europe’ project and doctoral candidate with the Digital Commerce research group of Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences) explains why these countries have been chosen: “France and Spain are in fourth and fifth place in terms of countries with the highest cross-border potential. This potential has been calculated on the basis of the revenue from cross-border consumer spending in foreign web shops. However, little is still known about France and Spain, making the choice for these countries an obvious one.”</p><a name="eztoc190091_1" id="eztoc190091_1"></a><h1>How does the cross-border tool work?</h1><p>The first question entrepreneurs are asked in the online tool is what type of entrepreneur they are: a starter in e-commerce, a starter abroad or a professional. They can also choose between France or Spain at this stage. After this, they are shown questions that are relevant to their ambition. The answers and input they give can then be used to create an advisory report. This personalised advice will support the most optimal roll-out of a successful expansion into France or Spain.</p><p>View the tool at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.crossbordertool.nl/" id="" target="_self">www.crossbordertool.nl</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><a name="eztoc190091_2" id="eztoc190091_2"></a><h1>Cross-border e-commerce trends in Europe</h1><p>The European e-commerce market is developing rapidly – a fact that applies to entrepreneurs and e-commerce companies, but also to European e-shoppers.

<div class="boxContent" data-index="news_header27_3990" style="display: none;">
<p><b>Best, 11 April 2017 – DPD and PostMasters has today announced that they are further expanding their partnership. This means that from now on you can send parcels via DPD from both the PostMasters Business Centres and the Express branches. DPD is responding to the increasing demand among consumers, entrepreneurs and SMEs for a broader range of postal and parcel services, and to not be dependent on a single party. Parcels can currently be sent via from the 30 PostMasters locations. The ambition is to expand these services over the course of the year to 100 locations across the country.</b></p><p>Individuals, entrepreneurs and SMEs that want DPD to deliver their parcels can do so by entrusting the entire service, from start to finish, to PostMasters. DPD itself has an extensive ground network in Europe and more than 30,000 Pickup parcelshops in 21 countries across the continent. This enables it to ensure that parcels reach their destination quickly and efficiently.</p><p>Eric Dietz, CEO of DPD Nederland: “With the ambition to be number 1 in the European parcel market, DPD wants to serve all market segments. Partnerships with other parties give DPD the opportunity to meet the demands of individuals, entrepreneurs and SMEs, <i>and</i> to grow in those segments. We have found a good partner in PostMasters for this market segment and we want to collaborate with them for the long term.”</p><p>Thomas van der Lubbe, CEO of PostMasters: “We are very enthusiastic at PostMasters about this new partnership with DPD. The high quality of their services and DPD’s intricate network in Europe, combined with PostMasters’ growing retail network, offers both companies opportunities to grow in the retail market. PostMasters and the PostMasters Express store-in-store formula serve many customers efficiently every day and thus enable the company to retain them successfully.

DPDgroup reveals changing online shopping habits of Europeans</label>
<div class="boxContent" data-index="news_header28_3990" style="display: none;">
<p><b>New pan-European survey uncovers trends; changing ways to pay, importance of trust and crumbling borders for shoppers in search of a bargain.</b></p><p>DPDgroup, the leading parcel delivery brand, today shines light on the rapidly changing landscape of online shopping in Europe in a new E-Shopper Barometer report.</p><p>In the first and most extensive report to focus on online shopping trends in Europe, Kantar TNS interviewed 23,450 participants across 21 countries*. The survey highlights micro trends including the most surprising online purchases as well as and preferred payment methods from the UK to Estonia. It also unearths macro trends such as the rapid growth of mobile shopping in countries with lower internet penetration, the increasing preference for e-shopping abroad, and the importance of transparency and flexibility offered in deliveries and returns.</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p>&nbsp;“Our report highlights the main e-commerce trends in Europe and provides a good overview of e-shoppers’ online behaviours, bearing in mind that these vary from country to country. Cross-border shopping is however popular across the region, with more than two thirds of those who purchase abroad doing so in other European countries. There’s also room for growth in coming years as a significant number of Europeans who have not yet purchased on foreign websites intend to do so.” <b>Jean-Claude Sonet, Marketing, Communication and CSR Director, DPDgroup</b></p><p> <b>Ways to shop and pay vary, but trust and flexibility are a key constant</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Most online purchases are still made by laptop or desktop PC. Orders made by smartphone (35 %) are growing, however, and 42 % of those surveyed said that they consider a mobile friendly website an essential factor in making purchases.</li>
<li>Digital wallets (e.g. PayPal) still outstrip credit cards as the preferred means of payment online (42 to 35 %), even in many Western European countries, while cash-on-delivery is most popular in the Eastern Bloc, highlighting the importance of trust when making purchases.</li>
<li>Home is still the preferred point of delivery for most (84 % of participants), but many are considering alternatives such as parcel delivery lockers or post offices, underlining the need for seamless delivery options that fit shoppers’ lifestyles.</li>
<li>Flexibility is key – most e-shoppers say next day delivery, realtime tracking and the option to reschedule are more likely to make them purchase from a specific retailer over other delivery options including weekend or evening deliveries. Nearly half of e-shoppers also rely on delivery time notifications provided by the courier.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Online shopping is driven by heavy buyers, but habits are changing</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Heavy buyers, account for 85 % of declared online purchases in Europe, meaning attracting repeat customers is now more important than ever for e-tailers. Flexible and reliable delivery options will be crucial in encouraging occasional buyers to purchase more frequently.</li>
<li>Internet penetration does not correlate with the average number of online purchases made each year; just 44 % of e-shoppers in the Netherlands (94 % population online) buy online once per month or more, compared to 52 % of Italians (just 66 % of population online).</li>
<li>Fashion, books, electronics, beauty and health products remain most popular across Europe, with some startling local variations. The UK is far ahead in %age of food purchases made online, while German shoppers are the most comfortable ordering medicine from websites.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b></p><p><b>European shoppers look for opportunities in neighbouring countries</b></p>
<ul>
<li>More than half of e-shoppers (52%) have made a purchase from a foreign website before, although an analysis of latest online purchases shows that only 17% were made on foreign websites, suggesting significant room for growth.</li>
<li>Fashion, electronics and books the most popular products types.</li>
<li>Western European countries favour geographic proximity for purchases on foreign websites – a third of e-shoppers buy on sites located in neighbouring markets.</li>
<li>Eastern European countries are likely to experience growth here, with 61% of Polish participants and 46% of Romanians indicating they are considering shipping abroad in future. </li>
<li>Shoppers need the cross-border experience to improve, particularly delivery and the returns process, as foreign websites do not always take into account specific local requirements or delivery networks. </li>
