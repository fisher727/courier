<p>Whose personal data do we process and why?</p></label>
<div class="drawerContent light black">
<p>DPD processes various categories of personal data of different persons, but only to the extent necessary to achieve the purpose of the processing. The “Scope of Data” indicated hereinbelow illustrates the maximum scope possible. Each processing operation concerns only those data that are relevant only to achieve the respective purpose.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>a. Data of Customers, Consignors and Consignees of the parcels</b></p><p>We process Identification Data relevant for providing shipping services and any tasks associated therewith duly and manifestly, including processing of orders, pickup and delivery of parcels, invoicing for the services, collecting any debts and documenting DPD business activities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b><i>Scope of the Data processed:</i></b><i>&nbsp;Identification Data, Contact Details (phone numbers, e-mail addresses) and other Data necessary to achieve the purpose. </i></p><p><i>For some services it may be necessary to process also Birth Dates, or Personal Identification Card Numbers, nevertheless, this is only the case where it is indispensable for such service or task.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Note: For purpose of this Data processing, except of the case when Date of Birth is provided, DPD is not to be considered Data Processor for the Data provided to arrangement and execution of the parcel delivery (Art. 28 GDPR), but is responsible for the Data as Data Controller. For this reason, except Recipient's age verification services, it is not necessary for the Consignors to conclude Data processing contracts with DPD.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>Why do we in specific cases require insight into the ID card and record some Data?</u></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Besides basic services we offer to our clients specific products that enable the Consignor to receive more security via sure identification of the person to whom the parcel was handed over. These products called Verified Handover and Verified Handover 18+. In these cases, the parcel can only be handed over to a person designated by the Consignor, in case of Verified Handover 18+, DPD will also check the age of the accepting person (Consignor is fully responsible for the statutory reason of Consignee’s age control, as in this case DPD acts only in the role of the Data processor).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>While parcel is handed over, we will record the last 5 numbers of the ID card and, in the case of verification of the Consignee's age, also a copy of the date of birth. With this we are able to assure the Consignor that his instructions were fully followed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The other case is to check the identity of the Consignee when delivering the parcel via parcel shop (Pickup). In this case, we also carry out the identity verification and the recording of the part of the document presented in order to ensure the safe handover of the parcel to the authorized person.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Verification of identity is not performed if the set-up of the service with the Consignor and the parcel shop allows us to use the security PIN that we will send the authorized Consignee before the parcel is ready for collection.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>b. Data of Contractors and their Representatives</b></p><p>We process necessary identification Data of representatives of our contractors and partners in order to ensure due performance of any contracts, or protection/enforcement of legitimate interests within our business relations and business activities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b><i>Scope of the Data processed:</i></b> Identification Data, Contact Details (phone numbers, e-mail addresses) and other Data necessary to achieve the purpose.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>c. Data of Employees of our Contractors</b></p><p>We process Identification Data of employees of other employers who carry out their work at DPD workplaces or who perform tasks arising out of any contracts on behalf of our contractors (where Data are necessary for the purposes of performance of such contracts) only to comply with our statutory duties (e.g. for the purposes of safety and health protection at work and fire prevention, protection of assets and legitimate interests of DPD, or, as the case may be, communication in business relations).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b><i>Scope of the Data processed:</i></b><i>&nbsp;Name and Surname, Contact Details (phone numbers, e-mail addresses), Signatures and other Data necessary to achieve the purpose. </i></p><p><i>If work is performed at DPD workplaces, these include also CCTV recordings, Identification Photos, or other Data necessary for the performance of the relevant contract, such as GPS coordinates of places where parcel labels are scanned. </i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>d. Data of Persons in employment relations (Employees) or similar relations with DPD</b></p><p>We process Identification Data and other necessary Data of our employees and temporary employees to fulfil our obligations and exercise our rights arising out of employment relations, social security, tax duties, protection of our assets and legitimate interests. Where legislation requires so, we may also process Data of other persons where it is essential for fulfilling any statutory duties, including Data of children and spouses of these persons.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b><i>Scope of the Data processed:</i></b><i>&nbsp;Name and Surname, Addresses, Contact Details (phone numbers, e-mail addresses), Signatures, Photos, required Information on Health screening, Data on Marital Status and other Data of similar nature, as well as Data on the Employment History, Data on using work tools and working hours, etc.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>e. Data of Visitors of DPD websites and of Users of online applications</b></p><p>We collect Data of visitors of our website, stored in Cookies (small files that allow DPD to save specific information about the PC of the visitors of our website during their visit to DPD website to ensure optimum functionality of the DPD website and online applications for the users, and also of monitoring of its functioning and protection). Cookies help us see the frequency of the visits, number of visitors and adjust our services so that they are comfortable and efficient for the users, and they also help us identify users when using online applications and store their preferred settings. Cookies may not enter users’ system. More information please find in section Use of DPD website cookies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b><i>Scope of the Data processed:</i></b><i>&nbsp;IP Addresses and User Settings in online applications.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>f. The Data of Recipients of marketing communications</b></p><p>We process contact details of persons representing our contractual clients and also of any other persons who have expressed their consent to marketing communications for the relevant purposes in order to offer our services and for other marketing and business purposes, and to inform them about any relevant facts associated with DPD activities. In this regard, DPD is not only bound by the Legislation on Personal Data Protection, but it also has to abide by the Act on Some Services of Information Society.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b><i>Scope of the Data processed:</i></b><i>&nbsp;Name and Surname, Contact Details (e-mail addresses).</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>g. The Data of Persons entering monitored DPD premises</b></p><p>DPD premises where parcels are handled are, mainly for security reasons, monitored by CCTV and the video recordings are stored. If a person enters the premises, he may be recorded by the CCTV. The use of the CCTV is subject to strict DPD rules and recordings are accessible only by a limited number of employees, and only for the purposes of addressing any security events. As a rule, recordings are stored for 60 days on secured servers. Places that are monitored are duly marked with informative signs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b><i>Scope of the Data processed:</i></b><i>&nbsp;Appearance and Behaviour of the persons in the monitored premises</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>h. The Data of Other Persons</b></p><p>In the diverse areas of DPD’s activities, sometimes it is necessary to process Data of persons that cannot be categorised in advance. In such cases, we always process the Data only to the extent necessary to achieve the relevant purpose of the processing and within a controlled process.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b><i>Scope of the Data processed:</i></b><i>&nbsp;Specific Data according to the purpose, while respecting the principle of data minimisation.</i></p> </div>

<p>We guarantee transparent approach in case anyone whose Data we process wishes to exercise their rights. We take requests of Data Subjects to exercise their rights seriously, and thus we also pay maximum attention to ascertain that these requests are raised by persons who are really authorised to do so. That means that before we address your request, we must verify the identity of the interested person (this does not apply to general queries regarding processing).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In line with the Legislation on Data Protection, we will respond to the requests of the Data Subject to exercise their right without undue delay, within 30 days from the date of filing the request and from ascertaining that the request was raised by an authorised person at the latest.

<p>DPD gives you the following options to exercise your rights:</p></label>
<div class="drawerContent light black">
<ul>
<li><p><b>By Data-Box</b></p><p>Requests sent to the Data-Box are considered as raised by the authorised person if the identity of the interested person is reasonably proven.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Using Contact details and DPD customer applications</b></p><p>Please raise your requests related to provision of information and rectification / partial modifications of the Data of the Senders and Recipients of the parcels in the relevant delivery or in the user settings by means of the DPD customer service (customer hotline, customer service applications, e-mails, or personally at our branch offices), or directly by means of customer applications designed to this aim.</p><p>In these cases, DPD reserves the right to verify the identity of the interested person prior to addressing the request where necessary (e.g. by phone). In the case of applications that allow users to handle the Data themselves and who have to log in, the login is considered sufficient for verification of the identity. For this reason, we advise you to follow the security instructions on protection of your login data.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Opting out of receiving marketing communications with every message</b></p><p>This is the most straightforward method of withdrawing your consent to the processing of your e-mail address for the purposes of marketing communications. Once you opt out of the receiving of the marketing communications, DPD will erase your contact details provided for this purpose.</p></li>
<li><b>In writing to the address of the registered office of DPD</b></li>
<li><p><b>By e-mail at <a href="http://www.dpd.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="204f534f424e495544414a45604450440e435a">[email&#160;protected]</a></b></p><p>This e-mail address is designed for making any general queries regarding the method of Data processing in DPD (information on Data processing or requests for information), requests for access to the Data, objections against the processing and requests for erasure of Data).</p></li>

This actually contributes to protection of your personal Data.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We do so:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>By comparing the Contact Data from which the request has been sent or raised with the Data of the Data Subject whose Data are requested. We send the information to these matching Contact addresses,</li>
<li>By checking whether the interested person knows the Data, especially in requests for rectification / modification of data,</li>
<li>By asking the interested person to produce his ID document,</li>
<li>By means of any other reliable proof.</li>

<p>What are your rights?</p></label>
<div class="drawerContent light black">
<p><b>a. Right to information or explanation</b></p><p>In this statement on Personal Data protection, we give you the basic information on the scope of the Data processing and on the key elements of the processing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We will provide you more information on the relevant Data processing at your request as long as it is indispensable for ensuring fair and transparent processing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>b. Right to access the Data</b></p><p>At your request, we will inform you whether we process your Data and in what scope. If requested, we can provide you with a copy of the Data. The right to obtain a copy of the Data processed may be restrained to prevent any negative interferences with the rights and freedoms of any third persons.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In some cases, e.g. in certain applications you may administer your Data on your own (through a user account).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>c. Right to rectification of Data and completion of Data</b></p><p>If we process your Data, you have the right to request their rectification if they are not accurate, or to request completion of any incomplete Data. However, when exercising the right to have the Data completed, we must take into account purposes of the processing so that we are not forced by the request to process data that we do not need for the purpose of the processing. Any Data provided without being requested by DPD, irrespective of who provides them, are excluded from liability of DPD.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>d. Right to erasure</b></p><p>If we process your Data, you may, while meeting certain conditions, have the right to request that your Data be erased and not retained any more. We will act on your request if:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>We do not need the Data for the purpose for which we have collected them or for any compatible and legitimate purposes any more,</li>
<li>We process your Data exclusively based on your consent,</li>
<li>You have objected to the processing and it was ascertained that in the particular case your interests in privacy protection prevail over the DPD’s interests in Data processing or you have objected to the processing for direct marketing purposes,</li>
<li>There is another lawful basis or decision binding on DPD.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is necessary to state here that we mostly process Data based on our statutory duties. In such cases it is not possible to request their erasure unless the purpose of their processing ceased to exist.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>e. Right to object and right to restriction of processing</b></p><p>You have the right to object to the processing of your Data. These situations include cases where you could not influence that we process your Data, and at the same time, they are not processed based on statutory duties or vital interests. We consider the objections according to the provisions of the Legislation on Data Protection and if we found the objections reasonable, we delete the Data in line with the objection.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, anyone whose Data we process has the right to ask for restriction of the processing of their Data. We will grant such a request if the criteria for such restriction specified in the Legislation on Data Protection are met, especially if the accuracy of Data, their lawful processing or the purpose of processing for which the Data were collected have been challenged. Restricted processing is automatically carried out when considering requests for erasure of Data or objections until the requests are cleared.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>f. Right of the Data Subjects to withdraw their consent to Data processing</b></p><p>If we have asked you for consent to the Data processing for a specific purpose and in the specific scope, you may withdraw your consent at any time by the relevant options we provide to you (e.g. opting out from marketing communications in any newsletter), or generally exercising this right by any means that DPD offers to you for such requests.</p> </div>

<p>Limitation of DPD’s liability</p></label>
<div class="drawerContent light black">
<p>We are liable for ensuring security of the Data we process during the entire time of processing, and for any damage caused by DPD both intentionally and by negligence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>However, there are cases where DPD’s liability is excluded, such as:</u></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Where the damage or injury is caused by you, i.e. by the Data Subjects, or by the original Data Controller who has transferred the Data to us. The cause may include incorrect or unlawful procedure of the Data transfer,</li>
<li>Where we have received the Data that we did not request, or where we did not agree with the Data provider on the transfer of the relevant Data,</li>
<li>Where we cannot be held liable for specific Data processing operation. E.g. our website includes also a number of external links to websites of other entities.
